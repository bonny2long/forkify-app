🍴 Forkify Recipe App
Forkify is a modern recipe application that allows users to search for food recipes, view detailed cooking instructions, and adjust serving sizes dynamically. It’s built using JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, SCSS, and bundled with Parcel.

This project is part of the coursework from Jonas Schmedtmann’s JavaScript course, where the focus is on building real-world applications while learning advanced JavaScript concepts.
